# 2023 Advent of Code challenges

These are my submissions to the
[2023 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023), written entirely in Rust.

Please note: A lot of these solutions are a bit hacky or poorly organized. I
haven't gone through to clean up the solutions once I got the right answers, and
there are known (and probably unknown) bugs for some solutions. Solutions
haven't been optimized for performance once the right answer has been reached.

For any questions about my solutions, please feel free to
[open an Issue](https://github.com/nikwithak/advent_of_code_2023/issues/new/choose).
