# 2023 Advent of Code challenges

These are my submissions to the
[2023 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023), solved in Rust.

Please note: A lot of these solutions are a bit hacky or poorly organized. They
are not necessarily written or documented in a way I'd write Production code. I
haven't gone through to clean up the solutions once I got the right answers, and
there are known bugs for some solutions. Solutions haven't been optimized for
performance once the right answer has been reached.

Each solution contains tests for the sample input, as well as the final answers.

For any questions about my solutions, approach, or if you discover an
undocumented bug, feel free to
[open an Issue](https://github.com/nikwithak/advent_of_code_2023/issues/new/choose).
