# 2023 Advent of Code challenges

These are my submissions to the
[2023 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2023), solved in Rust.

Please note: A lot of these solutions are a bit hacky or poorly organized. They
are not written or documented in the same way I'd write Production code, and
these solutions favor panicking and over-utilize `unwrap()`, rather than
handling errors appropriately. I haven't gone through to clean up the solutions
once I got the right answers, and there are known bugs for some solutions.
Solutions haven't been optimized for performance once the right answer has been
reached.

Each solution contains tests for the sample input, as well as the final answers.

For any questions about my solutions, approach, or if you discover an
undocumented bug, feel free to
[open an Issue](https://github.com/nikwithak/advent_of_code_2023/issues/new/choose).
